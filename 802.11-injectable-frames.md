Beacon (0x08),"Advertising an AP. Injecting custom beacons (with fake SSIDs or high power) can confuse clients and create ""Evil Twin"" honeypots."
Probe Request (0x04),Discovering APs. Can be injected to identify hidden networks or to test device responses.
Probe Response (0x05),Responding to a request. Can be injected to confuse clients by responding to their probe requests with misleading information.
Authentication (0x0B),"Initiating connection. Can be used to flood an AP with association requests, a form of Denial of Service (DoS)."
Deauthentication (0x0C),Forcing a disconnection. Injecting a deauthentication frame from the AP to a client (or vice versa) is a common method to disconnect a client.




RTS (Request to Send),"Reserving the medium. Can be used to claim the channel for a period, which is useful for collision avoidance or for DoS attacks by making excessive reservations."
CTS (Clear to Send),Granting channel access. Used in response to an RTS.
ACK (Acknowledgement),Confirming data reception. Injecting fake ACKs can confuse flow control and potentially lead to faster transmission rates or retransmissions.



IP (Internet Protocol),"Injecting raw IP packets allows you to send forged or custom packets at Layer 3. You can put any protocol inside (TCP, UDP, ICMP)."
ICMP (Ping),Injecting a crafted ICMP Echo Request or Response (ping) allows you to probe or deceive devices on the network.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol),"Injecting TCP SYN/ACK/FIN packets allows you to hijack or terminate existing connections (e.g., sending a forged RST to terminate a victim's web session)."
UDP (User Datagram Protocol),"Injecting UDP packets is used for protocols like DNS, DHCP, or specific VoIP traffic."
