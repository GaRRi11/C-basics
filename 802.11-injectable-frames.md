the only thing that gives ability to attacker to send authenticated packets in wlan is to encrypt it with valid PTK provided by wifi ap after authenticating with valid password. the encryption and decryption is handled by kernel.

if password in known attacker puts his interface in managed mode and normally connects to wifi ap. crafts the normal raw packets and sends them. the encryption, decryption is handled by kernel.

if password is known:
With the PTK, the attacker can decrypt all unicast (client-to-client or client-to-AP) traffic from that session, which was previously unreadable.

WPA2 Lack of Forward Secrecy: For WPA2, this is critical: if an attacker has been passively collecting encrypted traffic (packet sniffing) for weeks, gaining the password now allows them to decrypt all of that stored historical data. (WPA3 corrects this issue with a feature called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which provides forward secrecy.)

The attacker can now directly attempt to access the router/AP's web management interface. If the default administrator password has not been changed, they can gain full control over the network's configuration, firewall rules, and DNS settings.

They can use tools like Nmap to scan the entire network, discover other connected devices (e.g., servers, printers, IoT devices), and identify open ports and services, which is the necessary step before launching targeted attacks.

They can perform ARP Spoofing/Poisoning to redirect the traffic of other clients to their device. This is the setup for most MITM attacks, allowing the attacker to intercept, inspect, and modify traffic (e.g., steal credentials from unencrypted HTTP sessions or inject malware).







Beacon (0x08),"Advertising an AP. Injecting custom beacons (with fake SSIDs or high power) can confuse clients and create ""Evil Twin"" honeypots."
Probe Request (0x04),Discovering APs. Can be injected to identify hidden networks or to test device responses.
Probe Response (0x05),Responding to a request. Can be injected to confuse clients by responding to their probe requests with misleading information.
Authentication (0x0B),"Initiating connection. Can be used to flood an AP with association requests, a form of Denial of Service (DoS)."
Deauthentication (0x0C),Forcing a disconnection. Injecting a deauthentication frame from the AP to a client (or vice versa) is a common method to disconnect a client.




RTS (Request to Send),"Reserving the medium. Can be used to claim the channel for a period, which is useful for collision avoidance or for DoS attacks by making excessive reservations."
CTS (Clear to Send),Granting channel access. Used in response to an RTS.
ACK (Acknowledgement),Confirming data reception. Injecting fake ACKs can confuse flow control and potentially lead to faster transmission rates or retransmissions.



IP (Internet Protocol),"Injecting raw IP packets allows you to send forged or custom packets at Layer 3. You can put any protocol inside (TCP, UDP, ICMP)."
ICMP (Ping),Injecting a crafted ICMP Echo Request or Response (ping) allows you to probe or deceive devices on the network.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol),"Injecting TCP SYN/ACK/FIN packets allows you to hijack or terminate existing connections (e.g., sending a forged RST to terminate a victim's web session)."
UDP (User Datagram Protocol),"Injecting UDP packets is used for protocols like DNS, DHCP, or specific VoIP traffic."
